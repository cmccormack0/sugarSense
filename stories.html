            <h3>"The tracker changed my life..."</h3>
            <p>
                This is Anna Mack. She is 18 years old. She has struggled with diabetes since she was a little girl 
                since the disease runs in her family. After many failed meetings with specialists, she felt like she'd 
                never feel normal about her blood sugar, until she discovered SugarSense. Now, she is thriving and 
                has never felt more in control.

                This is Bella Wandover. She is 42 years old. She is a professional dancer. Because of this, she needs 
                energy to last long rehearsals and performances. She found the company in 2019 and has used our tracker 
                every day since. Learn more about Bella’s story below!

                I made it my mission to let nobody else struggle the way they did with tracking!
